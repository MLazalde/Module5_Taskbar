# Todo Taskbar

The task bar is set up to be able to add task by clicking on the Add Tasks button. Once pressed, a modal will appear requiring you to fill out the Name of the Task, the due date, and a brief description of the task. (an error message will pop up if any of the fields, as will if the due date is in the past)

Once a task is created, it will appear in the to-do section. Once you begin the task, you can drag it to the "In process" section, then to the "done" column, as appropriate.

If you decide that the task is no longer relevant, you will be able to press the delete button located on the task to remove it from the board.
